			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>
				Hello, and thank you for visiting FashionPlastics! We are a small team of devoted environmentalists who develop and sell bioplastic fabrics for use in the fashion industry. Bioplastics are the future of fashion, taking less energy to produce and being more easy to recycle than typical nylons and polyesters (while maintaining their light weight and breathability). However, bioplastics currently make up less than 1% of the global plastic market, despite their environmental benefits. Our goal is to take bioplastics to mainstream fashion by developing high quality textiles and selling them to retailers. Our fabrics are still under development, but you should look out for our clothing soon!

			<h3>Why Bioplastics?</h3>
			<p>
				I have long been interested in fashion, but am also concerned about the environment and taking care of the planet. Unfortunately, fashion and environmentalism are often at odds when the majority of clothing brands manufacture clothes unsustainably. One thing I've personally heard from friends who buy a lot of clothes is that they can always just donate or recycle them, as if it's a 100% way of eliminating waste. In reality, very few donated clothes ever reach a second user, and a majority of garments are thrown out of thrift store racks after never being sold. Bioplastics provide a solution to this conundrum.

			<h3>Where can I find FashionPlastics products?</h3>
